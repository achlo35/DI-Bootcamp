// Exercise 6 : Guess the answers #3
// Instructions
// For each expression, in a Javascript file in VS CODE, predict what you think the output will be in a comment (//) without first running the command.
// Of course, explain each prediction.

// Then run the expression in the console of your browser (NOT IN VS CODE).

// Note the actual output in a comment and compare it with your prediction.



// What is the output of each of the expressions below?

5 + "34"
// Prediction: 543, because we are concatenating a number with a string.
// Actual:  "534"

5 - "4"
// Prediction: NaN, because we cannot subtract a string from a number.
// Actual: 1

10 % 5
// Prediction: 0, because 10 is divisible by 5 with no remainder.
// Actual: 0

5 % 10
// Prediction: 5, because 5 is the remainder when 5 is divided by 10.
// Actual: 5

" " + " "
// Prediction: "  ", because we are concatenating two empty strings.
// Actual: "  "

" " + 0
// Prediction: " 0", because we are concatenating a string with a number.
// Actual: " 0"

true + true
// Prediction: 2, because true is treated as 1 in arithmetic operations.
// Actual: 2

true + false
// Prediction: 1, because true is treated as 1 and false as 0 in arithmetic operations.
// Actual: 1

false + true
// Prediction: 1, because false is treated as 0 and true as 1 in arithmetic operations.
// Actual: 1

false - true
// Prediction: -1, because false is treated as 0 and true as 1 in arithmetic operations.
// Actual: -1

!true
// Prediction: false, because the logical NOT operator negates the value of true.
// Actual: false

3 - 4
// Prediction: -1, because we are subtracting 4 from 3.
// Actual: -1
