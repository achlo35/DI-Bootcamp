// Exercise 4 : Guess the answers #1
// Instructions
// For each expression, predict what you think the output will be in a comment (//) without first running the command.
// Of course, explain each prediction.
// Then run the expression in the console. Note the actual output in a comment and compare it with your prediction.

let c;
let a = 34;
let b = 21;

console.log(a+b) //first expression
// Prediction: Answer is 55, because we are adding two numbers together.
// Actual:

a = 2;

console.log(a+b) //second expression
// Prediction: Answer is 23, because value of a is now 2
// Actual: 23

// What is the value of c?
//Prediction: c is undefined because it has not been assigned a value.

console.log(3 + 4 + '5');
// Prediction: Answer is 75, because 3 + 4 is 7 and then '5' is concatenated to it.
// Actual: 75
